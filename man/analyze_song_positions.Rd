\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame in concertData format, containing at least 'tour', 'showID', 'song_title', and 'song_position' columns.}

\item{max_songs_by_tour}{A data frame with 'tour' and 'max_songs' columns, typically output from longest_setlist_by_tour function.}

\item{tour_order}{A data frame with a 'tour' column specifying the desired order of tours (optional).}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
  \itemize{
    \item tour: Name of the tour (as a factor if tour_order is provided)
    \item position_bin: The song position in the setlist
    \item unique_songs: Number of unique songs played in this position
    \item total_occurrences: Total number of songs played in this position
    \item most_common_song: The most frequently played song in this position
    \item most_common_freq: Frequency of the most common song
    \item predictability: Ratio of most_common_freq to total_occurrences
