\title{Transform City Frequency Data}
\usage{
transform_city_frequency(city_frequency, breaks)
}
\arguments{
\item{city_frequency}{A data frame containing city frequency information, including a 'show_count' column.}

\item{breaks}{A numeric vector of break points for categorizing show counts.}
}
\value{
A data frame with additional columns for log-transformed show counts and show count categories.
}
\description{
This function transforms the city frequency data by adding a log-transformed
show count and categorizing cities based on their show counts using custom breaks.
}
\examples{
city_frequency <- data.frame(
  city = c("New York", "London", "Paris", "Berlin"),
  country = c("USA", "UK", "France", "Germany"),
  show_count = c(50, 25, 10, 1)
)
breaks <- c(0, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, Inf)
transformed_data <- transform_city_frequency(city_frequency, breaks)
}
